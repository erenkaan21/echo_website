  tagline: "Deniz will find the origin of the medallion that has unconsciously haunted all her life.",
  synopsis: `ECHO is a story about reincarnation, centered on the Timucuan people, an extinct Native population from the 1500s. A shaman, foreseeing his people's destruction, casts a spell in 1550, trapping their spirits in a medallion. Ela, a young girl present during the ritual, shares the shaman's fate. Much like the thirst for gold which drew the conquistadors to the shores of the new world, the film's characters seek to risk all to possess the coveted medallion, only to find unknown consequences and dangers which they must resolve. Centuries later, in modern-day St. Augustine, Luis finds the medallion buried in the sand and seeks answers from Esmeralda, a psychic who activates it. Meanwhile, in Rome, painter Deniz experiences vivid dreams about Ela and the medallion. As its power awakens within her, Deniz learns of her ancestral connection to the Timucua spirits. She meets Luis at an art show in Miami, where she faces threats from treasure hunters and uncovers the medallion's abilities. Luis takes her to St. Augustine, where Esmeralda reveals the medallion's role in resurrecting other ancient populations. Just as Deniz begins to understand her destiny, Luis reveals his true intentions, aiming to take the activated medallion from her.`,

  targetAudience: "This film targets teenagers and young adults, particularly those who appreciate culturally rich international stories. It appeals to open-minded viewers, intellectuals, and diverse audiences of all genders, with a special focus on Hispanic communities.",

  ourAim: `Echo is the beginning of our idea to expand it into a feature movie. The movie will present a different story and a different set of characters; the only element that will connect to Echo will be an ancient culture discovery and a different medallion/object. New heroes from other cultures and times will emerge and unite for the good of the world. In the feature movie, there will be a tough fight against those who want to abuse this power, but with the union of forces, goodness will win because the world and people need it. People need hope especially in this historical period that we are living.`,
